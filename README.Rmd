The goal of codeexplode is to ...

## Installation


And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with `devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/codeexplode")`


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(codeexplode)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) ->
  summary_cars

library(ggplot2) 
cars %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) + 
  geom_point(size = 4) + 
  aes(color = speed) + 
  scale_color_viridis_c()

```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure) ->
  p

p
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
